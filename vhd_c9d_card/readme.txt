kicad files for victor vhd c9d card

schematics part is up to date, but PCB is not yet up to date, is missing connection from A6 towards RESET pin in 8255 ic.
When that is missing connection was handmade, it has been tested quickly and seems to control VHD player just like the original C9D card.
But no guarantee that everything works 100%
