VHD interface for cartridge slot in MSX 1
-Made from reverse engineering IF-C9D card.
-also contains pin headers to connect VHD data extraction pcb
-can be used to play games like Time Gal, Thunder Storm, Road Blaster where the game code is loaded from cassette tape.
-not possible to play games like VROOM and Star Arthur (even though the HW parts are now resolved) as game code is loaded from VHD disk itself and the code is in intermediate language that can be only interpreted by CALL VHD basic extension program.
-only full ROM dump from Victor IF-7900, IF-7910, IF-C9C, or National DA-80F is missing to be able to use CALL VHD basic extension (and thus play VROOM)
