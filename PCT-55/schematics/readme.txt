Partial schematics for pct-55.
Currently missing:
-two L component values (L503 on main PCB, L on the solder side on MSX PCB)
-transformer turns ratio for transformers T351, T501 and Flyback
-exact coil connections related to pins in T501 and Flyback transformers
-tuner box schematics (will not be made)

May have errors in drawn schematics...
